  <p>I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100. You may ask me a number, and I will tell you if the number I am thinking of is higher, lower or equal to your guess. Once you figure out the number, print out <code>! x</code>, where x is your guess.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div id='problem-input'>
  <p>Use standard input to read responses. The input will contain responses to your queries. Make sure to flush the output after each of your questions. The response will be <code>higher</code> if the number is greater than your number, <code>lower</code> if it is less than your number, and <code>eqal</code> if it is equal. The number I am thinking of is 1 <= n <= 100</p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
